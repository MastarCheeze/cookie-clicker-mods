QOL mods to improve the overall experience of [Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) without altering the gameplay too much.

## [Cookie Shortcuts](./cookieshortcuts/README.md)

Fully customisable keyboard shortcuts for 40+ different actions. Create shortcut combos to perform multiple actions with one shortcut.

## [Hoverclicker](./hoverclicker/README.md)

Click the big cookie, golden cookies and more by just hovering over them.

## [Antisleep](./antisleep/README.md)

A small script to keep Cookie Clicker running in the background while not in focus.

## [What Lump Did I Harvest](./whatlumpdidiharvest/README.md)

A mod that changes the 'You harvested _n_ sugar lumps while you were away' notification to be more helpful.

## Miscellaneous

Scripts that are either too simple to be a mod, not complete, or I'm lazy to add a UI.
